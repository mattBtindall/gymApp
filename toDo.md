To do:

[In no particular order]


. Sort navbar.php -> currently it doesn't look good on mobiles - the searchbar hides when it shoulnd't and the file as a whole is a bit of a mess. Need to figure out which files the modals/popovers should be in.

. Need to figure out how to split the modal php stuff from Members.php -> this should be present in more files.
